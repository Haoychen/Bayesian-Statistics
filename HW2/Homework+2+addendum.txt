 
On problem 3 (Chapter 3 Exercise 7): 
 
For the binomial model you have to assume that total vehicles b+v has a Poisson distribution, and b is *conditionally* Binomial.  


 
On problem 5 (Chapter 3 Exercise 11):
 
Part (a).  "Reproduce all the computations" here means: contour plot of posterior adjacent to scatterplot of random sample, analogous to Figure 3.3 (both plots on the same scale!); and histogram of random sample from posterior of LD50, analogous to Figure 3.4
